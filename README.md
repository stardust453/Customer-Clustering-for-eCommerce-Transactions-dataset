# Customer-Clustering-for-eCommerce-Transactions-dataset
This project involved analyzing an eCommerce Transactions dataset consisting of customer, product, and transaction information. The tasks completed were:

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Performed comprehensive analysis of the dataset, deriving 5 key business insights presented in a concise report.

#Lookalike Model: 
Developed a model to recommend 3 similar customers based on user profiles and transaction history. The model incorporated both customer and product data, assigning similarity scores to recommendations. Top 3 lookalikes were identified for the first 20 customers.

#Customer Segmentation: 
Implemented clustering techniques to segment customers using both profile and transaction data. The optimal number of clusters (between 2-10) was determined, and clustering metrics including the Davies-Bouldin Index were calculated. Cluster visualizations were created to represent the segmentation results.
The project demonstrated skills in data analysis, machine learning, and business insight generation, with a focus on creating actionable strategies to improve the company's business operations.
